Emerging technologies such as Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, P2P payments and lending, Robo-advisory, and Crowdfunding are disrupting traditional business models. The need to digitally transform and innovate in a customer-centric and engaging manner has never been more important to traditional financial service providers than now."}
